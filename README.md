# poggersBot
 discord bot for the funny, written in python

This is my first discord bot.
It was at first made to only respond to the word "poggers", but later became a collection of inside jokes for our server.

To use:

 - Edit the chosen python file and put in your discord bot token

 - If on windows you can just double-click the .bat file for the chosen version

 - Otherwise run the python file with python 3.7


This repo contains both the original and the simplified version.

 - The simplified version only triggers at the words "poggers" and "amogus".

 - The original has much more triggers, check triggers.txt for the list.

 - Both versions have commands, the bot uses the prefix "pog, " to get help use "pog, help"


Features:

 - triggers at certain words and replies with something related to the word

 - has ai generated images with the triggers cat, animu, waifu, poney, forry

 - has various commands

 - can play mp3s and youtube links


Notes:

 - .\minecraft\ only has two mp3's but you can add more

 - you can also add mp3's to .\mp3\

 - the play command barely works, in general mp3 playback is badly done
